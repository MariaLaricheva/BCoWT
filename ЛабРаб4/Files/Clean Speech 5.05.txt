There are 55,000 people here tonight. 55,000 people on the first night of my world tour. What do you think about that, Tokyo? I know, we’ve got 50,000… 55,000 people here tonight – I can only assume that maybe some of you at one point or another have gone through a hard time in your life. Um, and I can only assume that the way you deal with sadness, or tough times, is the same way that I deal with it. I turn to music, and, really, you wouldn’t be here if you didn’t turn to music in hard times; I wouldn’t be here if I didn’t turn to music. And it makes me feel that we have that in common. Um, I think that it is probably very possible that a lot of you have experienced a lot of rainy days that never really got brighter, or maybe you fell in love with a person or something that is bad for you and couldn’t quit, or maybe you lost someone that you never expected that you would lose, or maybe you lost yourself; that’s even worse. When you have bad days that just won’t let up, I just hope that you will look in the mirror and remind yourself of what you are, and what you are not. You are not your mistakes. You are not damaged goods or money from your failed explorations. You are not the opinion of someone who doesn’t know you. You are a product of the lessons you have learned. You are wiser because you went through something terrible. And you are the person who survived a bunch of rainstorms and kept walking. I… I now believe that pain makes you stronger. I now believe that walking through a lot of rainstorms gets you clean.
