When I go through difficult or complicated times in my life, I turn to music and I turn to you, and that’s why I’m so happy to see you in person – to thank you for that. And maybe what you went through was falling in love with someone or something that was bad for you but you couldn’t quit, or maybe what happened to you was that you didn’t know where to go next, and you felt confused about where you were even headed. Or maybe you felt like you didn’t fit in anywhere, in any corner of the room. Maybe you lost someone you never thought you would lose, or maybe you lost yourself which is the worst thing out of all of it. I know that you’re going to go through more of it in your life and so am I, and that people are going to say things about us that aren’t true. And I just want you, in those moments, to look in the mirror and understand what you are, and what you are not. You are not somebody else’s opinion of you. You are not damaged goods just because you’ve made a few mistakes in your life. You are not going nowhere just because you haven’t arrived at your final destination yet. What you are is wiser and stronger because you made mistakes. What you are is brave for living your life in a daring way that would cause you to take the risks it takes to make mistakes. What you are is someone who’s walked through a bunch of rainstorms, but continues to put one foot in front of the other. And I think that at 25 years I’m still learning every single day, but one thing I do know is that pain actually does make you stronger, and walking through a bunch of rainstorms does not make you damaged. If you keep on going, it actually makes you clean.
