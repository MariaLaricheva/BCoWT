Maybe you lost your way. Maybe you lost someone you thought you’d never lose. Maybe you lost yourself. Maybe you fell in love with a person or a habit and couldn’t quit; it was bad for you. Maybe you have absolutely no idea where you’re gonna go next. And I think that, when we get to these places in our lives where we feel like there are so many rainy days in a row and it never seems to get brighter, I just hope you’ll look in the mirror and remind yourself of what you are, and what you are not. You are not someone else’s opinion of you. You are not damaged goods just because you’ve made a few mistakes. You are wiser because you’ve made mistakes. You are someone who’s been rained on over and over again and kept putting one foot in front of the other.
